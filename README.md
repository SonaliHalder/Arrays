This repository contains basic C++ programs that demonstrate array operations.  
These are part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey.

## Programs Included
- Linear Search
- Reverse Array
- Find Minimum and Maximum
- Sum of Elements

## How to Use
Each `.cpp` file can be compiled and run using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, CodeBlocks, or Visual Studio Code).
